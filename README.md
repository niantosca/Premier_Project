# Project_1
This is a group project that I worked on with 3 others. We aimed to create an application in which the user can search events based upon an entered Zip Code. The user would not only get event information back, but also
the corresponding weather during the events. We employed the use of two API's, Eventbrite and openWeather to accomplish this. You may also notice a non-functioning area towards the bottom of the page (picture of a map).
This is currently a placeholder for the future development and addition of Google Maps in order to see exactly where each event is within the users' area.
